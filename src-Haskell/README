matrixtree.hs defines a recursive data structure MatrixTree for representing
matrices, with an emphasis on efficient representation of sparse matrices.

matrixmarket.hs contains functions for reading/writing files in MatrixMarket
formats, populating MatrixTrees with the results.

rowformat.hs contains functions for reading/writing files in a format that 
lists the rows of a matrix in order, one per line, with entries in a given 
row separated by spaces.

spamm.hs contains functions for performing matrix algebra on MatrixTrees
using the SpAMM algorithm.

tests.hs loads MatrixMarket-formatted files from the folder "Test matrices" 
and performs SpAMM operations on them, reporting on the correctness of the 
results.

To use SpAMM in a code, import spamm.hs and the module for the file format(s)
you plan to read/write.

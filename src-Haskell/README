MatrixTree.hs defines a recursive data structure MatrixTree for representing
matrices, with an emphasis on efficient representation of sparse matrices.
It also provides functions for reading/writing MatrixTrees to files in 
MatrixMarket formats.

MatrixMarket.hs contains functions to read/write between MatrixMarket
format files and a generic matrix data structure.

SpAMM.hs contains functions for performing matrix algebra on MatrixTrees
using the SpAMM algorithm.

The folder Testing contains a script tests.hs that loads MatrixMarket files
from the folder Matrices, performs SpAMM operations on them, and reports on
the correctness of the results. Compile tests.hs with -i.:.. so it can
find the modules it needs.

To use SpAMM in a code, import MatrixTree.hs (for reading/writing files) 
and SpAMM.hs.

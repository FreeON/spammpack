MatrixTree.hs defines a recursive data structure MatrixTree for representing
matrices, with an emphasis on efficient representation of sparse matrices.

MatrixMarket.hs contains functions for reading/writing files in MatrixMarket
formats, populating MatrixTrees with the results.

RowFormat.hs contains functions for reading/writing files in a format that
lists the rows of a matrix in order, one per line, with entries in a given
row separated by spaces.

SpAMM.hs contains functions for performing matrix algebra on MatrixTrees
using the SpAMM algorithm.

The folder Testing contains a script tests.hs that loads MatrixMarket files
from the folder Matrices, performs SpAMM operations on them, and reports on
the correctness of the results. Compile tests.hs with -i.:.. so it can
find the modules it needs.

To use SpAMM in a code, import SpAMM.hs and the module for the file format(s)
you plan to read/write.

@article{Chi2014,
abstract = {This paper proposes a simple sensing and estimation framework to faithfully recover the principal subspace of high-dimensional datasets or data streams from a collection of one-bit measurements from distributed sensors based on comparing accumulated energy projections of their data samples of dimension n over pairs of randomly selected directions. By leveraging low-dimensional structures, the top eigenvectors of a properly designed surrogate matrix is shown to recover the principal subspace of rank \$r\$ as soon as the number of bit measurements exceeds the order of \$nr\^{}2 \backslash log n\$, which can be much smaller than the ambient dimension of the covariance matrix. The sample complexity to obtain reliable comparison outcomes is also obtained. Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity online algorithm to track the principal subspace that allows new bit measurements arrive sequentially. Numerical examples are provided to validate the proposed approach.},

abstract = {This is a set of notes on some unrelated topics in mathematical physics, at varying levels of detail. First, I consider certain questions relating to the decay of correlation functions in matrix product states, in particular those generated by quantum expanders. This is discussed in relation to recent results of Brandao and Horodecki on area laws on systems with exponentially decaying correlation function$\backslash$cite\{areaexp\}. Second, I consider some difficulties in trying to construct a tensor product state (or PEPS) describing a two-dimensional fermionic system with non-vanishing Hall conductance. Third, I present some relations between the theory of almost commuting matrices and that of vector bundles, making the connection between the classifications more explicit. Fourth, I present an open question about quantum channels, and some partial results.},

Combined with techniques from approximation theory, the bounds are used to compute sparse (or banded) approximations to f(A), resulting in algorithms that under appropriate conditions have linear complexity in the matrix dimension. Applications to various types of problems are discussed and illustrated by numerical examples.}

Bock, arXiv 1011.3534, 2010], a fast algorithm for matrix-matrix multiplication for matrices with decay that achieves an \$\backslash mathcal\{O\} ( n \backslash log n )\$ computational complexity with respect to matrix dimension \$n\$. We find that the max norm of the error achieved with a SpAMM tolerance below \$2 \backslash times 10\^{}\{-8\}\$ is lower than that of the single-precision general matrix-matrix multiply (SGEMM\}) for dense quantum chemical matrices, while outperforming SGEMM with a cross-over already for small matrices (\$n \backslash sim 1000\$). Relative to naive implementations of SpAMM using Intel's Math Kernel Library or AMD's Core Math Library, our optimized version is found to be significantly faster. Detailed performance comparisons are made for quantum chemical matrices with differently structured sub-blocks. Finally, we discuss the potential of improved hardware prefetch to yield 2x to 3x speedups.},

 reduces the dimensionality of the problem and provides a way to assign
 different spatially local parts of the cell to each processor. The
 scheme is independent of the number of processors. It can be used for
 both ordered and disordered structures and does not depend on the
 dimensionality or shape of the system. Details of implementation in the
 linear-scaling density functional code CONQUEST, as well as several case
 studies of systems of various complexity, containing up to 55,755

  Abstract                 = {A fast algorithm for the approximate multiplication of matrices with decay is introduced; the Sparse Approximate Matrix Multiply (SpAMM) reduces complexity in the product space, a different approach from current methods that economize within the matrix space through truncation or rank reduction. Matrix truncation (element dropping) is compared to SpAMM for quantum chemical matrices with approximate exponential and algebraic decay. For matched errors in the electronic total energy, SpAMM is found to require fewer to far fewer floating point operations relative to dropping. The challenges and opportunities afforded by this new approach are discussed, including the potential for high performance implementations.},

  Abstract                 = {QUANTUM ESPRESSO is an integrated suite of computer codes for electronic-structure calculations and materials modeling, based on density-functional theory, plane waves, and pseudopotentials (norm-conserving, ultrasoft, and projector-augmented wave). The acronym ESPRESSO stands for opEn Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization . It is freely available to researchers around the world under the terms of the GNU General Public License. QUANTUM ESPRESSO builds upon newly-restructured electronic-structure codes that have been developed and tested by some of the original authors of novel electronic-structure algorithms and applied in the last twenty years by some of the leading materials modeling groups worldwide. Innovation and efficiency are still its main focus, with special attention paid to massively parallel architectures, and a great effort being devoted to user friendliness. QUANTUM ESPRESSO is evolving towards a distribution of independent and interoperable codes in the spirit of an open-source project, where researchers active in the field of electronic-structure calculations are encouraged to participate in the project by contributing their own codes or by implementing their own ideas into existing codes.}

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present an efficient implementation of general tensor contractions, which is part of a new coupled-cluster program. The tensor contractions, used to evaluate the residuals in each coupled-cluster iteration are particularly important for the performance of the program. We developed a generic procedure, which carries out contractions of two tensors irrespective of their explicit structure. It can handle coupled-cluster-type expressions of arbitrary excitation level. To make the contraction efficient without loosing flexibility, we use a three-step procedure. First, the data contained in the tensors are rearranged into matrices, then a matrix-matrix multiplication is performed, and finally the result is backtransformed to a tensor. The current implementation is significantly more efficient than previous ones capable of treating arbitrary high excitations.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed a symbolic manipulation program and program generator (tensor contraction engine or TCE) that abstracts and automates the time-consuming, error-prone processes of deriving the working equations of a well-defined model of second-quantized many-electron theories and synthesizing efficient parallel computer programs on the basis of these equations. Provided an ansatz of a many-electron theory model, TCE performs valid contractions of creation and annihilation operators according to Wick's theorem, consolidates identical terms, and reduces the expressions into the form of multiple tensor contractions acted upon by permutation operators. It subsequently determines the binary contraction order for each multiple tensor contraction with the minimal operation and memory cost, factorizes common binary contractions (defines intermediate tensors), and identifies reusable intermediates. The resulting ordered list of binary tensor contractions, additions, and index permutations is translated into an optimized program that is combined with the NWCHEM and UTCHEM computational chemistry software packages. The programs synthesized by TCE take advantage of spin symmetry (within the spinorbital formalisms), real Abelian point-group symmetry, and index permutation symmetry at every stage of the calculations to minimize the number of arithmetic operations and storage requirement, adjust the peak local memory usage by index-range tiling, and support parallel I/O interfaces and dynamic load balancing for parallel executions. We demonstrate the utility of TCE through automatic derivation and implementation of parallel programs for a range of predictive computational methodsconfiguration-interaction theory (CISD, CISDT, CISDTQ), generalized many-body perturbation theory MBPT(2), MBPT(3), MBPT(4), and coupled-cluster theory (LCCD, CCD, LCCSD, CCSD, QCISD, CCSDT, and CCSDTQ), some for the first timeand discuss the performance of the implemented programs.},

  Abstract                 = {The approximate self-consistent field equations of Roothaan (1951) are studied from the standpoint of density matrix theory. Their direct solution, which entails repeated determination of the individual occupied orbitals, is shown to be quite unnecessary. All information about the system under consideration can be obtained in terms of a one-particle density matrix; and this can be constructed by an iterative method which involves only matrix algebra. As an illustration of the method, the ground state of the beryllium atom is calculated. The solution, which is approximated in a basis of four Slater functions, surpasses in accuracy all other analytical one-determinant wave functions so far available, with one exception (Holoien, 1955). And although it approaches the accurate solution of the Hartree-Fock equations the computation required is relatively small. Extensions of the method, in order to admit configuration-interaction calculations, are also discussed. An appendix introduces a 'steepest descent' method of solving eigenvalence problems, which may be regarded as the prototype of the iterative construction described in the paper.},

The scheme works with a predefined occupation and requires less than half the number of matrix-matrix multiplications compared to existing methods at low (90\%) occupancy. The expansion can be used with a fixed chemical potential in which case it is an asymmetric generalization of and a substantial improvement over grand canonical McWeeny purification. It is shown that the computational complexity, measured as number of matrix multiplications, essentially is independent of system size even for metallic materials with a vanishing band gap.},

  Abstract                 = {We provide a general framework for the understanding of inexact Krylov subspace methods for the solution of symmetric and nonsymmetric linear systems of equations, as well as for certain eigenvalue calculations. This framework allows us to explain the empirical results reported in a series of CERFACS technical reports by Bouras, Fraysse, and Giraud in 2000. Furthermore, assuming exact arithmetic, our analysis can be used to produce computable criteria to bound the inexactness of the matrix-vector multiplication in such a way as to maintain the convergence of the Krylov subspace method. The theory developed is applied to several problems including the solution of Schur complement systems, linear systems which depend on a parameter, and eigenvalue problems. Numerical experiments for some of these scientific applications are reported.},

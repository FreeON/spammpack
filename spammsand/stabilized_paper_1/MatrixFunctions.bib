@article{Chi2014,
abstract = {This paper proposes a simple sensing and estimation framework to faithfully recover the principal subspace of high-dimensional datasets or data streams from a collection of one-bit measurements from distributed sensors based on comparing accumulated energy projections of their data samples of dimension n over pairs of randomly selected directions. By leveraging low-dimensional structures, the top eigenvectors of a properly designed surrogate matrix is shown to recover the principal subspace of rank \$r\$ as soon as the number of bit measurements exceeds the order of \$nr\^{}2 \backslash log n\$, which can be much smaller than the ambient dimension of the covariance matrix. The sample complexity to obtain reliable comparison outcomes is also obtained. Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity online algorithm to track the principal subspace that allows new bit measurements arrive sequentially. Numerical examples are provided to validate the proposed approach.},

abstract = {This is a set of notes on some unrelated topics in mathematical physics, at varying levels of detail. First, I consider certain questions relating to the decay of correlation functions in matrix product states, in particular those generated by quantum expanders. This is discussed in relation to recent results of Brandao and Horodecki on area laws on systems with exponentially decaying correlation function$\backslash$cite\{areaexp\}. Second, I consider some difficulties in trying to construct a tensor product state (or PEPS) describing a two-dimensional fermionic system with non-vanishing Hall conductance. Third, I present some relations between the theory of almost commuting matrices and that of vector bundles, making the connection between the classifications more explicit. Fourth, I present an open question about quantum channels, and some partial results.},

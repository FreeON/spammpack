abstract = {Traditional finite difference (FD) methods are designed to be exact for low degree polynomials. They can be highly effective on Cartesian-type grids, but may fail for unstructured node layouts. Radial basis function-generated finite difference (RBF-FD) methods overcome this problem and, as a result, provide a much improved geometric flexibility. The calculation of RBF-FD weights involves a shape parameter ??. Small values of ?? (corresponding to near-flat RBFs) often lead to particularly accurate RBF-FD formulas. However, the most straightforward way to calculate the weights (RBF-Direct) becomes then numerically highly ill-conditioned. In contrast, the present algorithm remains numerically stable all the way into the ?????0 limit. Like the RBF-QR algorithm, it uses the idea of finding a numerically well-conditioned basis function set in the same function space as is spanned by the ill-conditioned near-flat original Gaussian RBFs. By exploiting some properties of the incomplete gamma function, it transpires that the change of basis can be achieved without dealing with any infinite expansions. Its strengths and weaknesses compared with the Contour-Pad??, RBF-RA, and RBF-QR algorithms are discussed. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The emergence of cloud computing and Google's MapReduce paradigm is renewing interest in the development of broadly applicable high level abstractions as a means to deliver easy programmability and cyber resources to the user, while hiding complexities of system architecture, parallelism and algorithms, heterogeneity, and fault-tolerance. In this paper, we present a high-level framework for computations on tree structures. Despite the diversity and types of tree structures, and the algorithmic ways in which they are utilized, our abstraction provides sufficient generality to be broadly applicable. We show how certain frequently used operations on tree structures can be cast in terms of our framework. We further demonstrate the applicability of our framework by solving two applications -- k-nearest neighbors and fast multipole method (FMM) based simulations -- by merely using our framework in multiple ways. We developed a generic programming based implementation of the framework using C++ and MPI, and demonstrate its performance on the aforementioned applications using homogeneous multi-core clusters.},

	for matrices with decay that achieves an \$\backslash mathcal\{O\}
	( n \backslash log n )\$ computational complexity with respect to
	matrix dimension \$n\$. We find that the max norm of the error achieved

	multiply (SGEMM\}) for dense quantum chemical matrices, while outperforming
	SGEMM with a cross-over already for small matrices (\$n \backslash

  abstract = {This paper proposes a simple sensing and estimation framework to faithfully
	recover the principal subspace of high-dimensional datasets or data
	streams from a collection of one-bit measurements from distributed
	sensors based on comparing accumulated energy projections of their
	data samples of dimension n over pairs of randomly selected directions.
	By leveraging low-dimensional structures, the top eigenvectors of
	a properly designed surrogate matrix is shown to recover the principal
	subspace of rank \$r\$ as soon as the number of bit measurements
	exceeds the order of \$nr\^{}2 \backslash log n\$, which can be much
	smaller than the ambient dimension of the covariance matrix. The
	sample complexity to obtain reliable comparison outcomes is also
	obtained. Furthermore, we develop a low-complexity online algorithm
	to track the principal subspace that allows new bit measurements
	arrive sequentially. Numerical examples are provided to validate
	the proposed approach.},

	attention paid to massively parallel architectures, and a great effort
	being devoted to user friendliness. QUANTUM ESPRESSO is evolving
	towards a distribution of independent and interoperable codes in
	the spirit of an open-source project, where researchers active in
	the field of electronic-structure calculations are encouraged to
	participate in the project by contributing their own codes or by

	We developed a generic procedure, which carries out contractions
	of two tensors irrespective of their explicit structure. It can handle
	coupled-cluster-type expressions of arbitrary excitation level. To
	make the contraction efficient without loosing flexibility, we use
	a three-step procedure. First, the data contained in the tensors
	are rearranged into matrices, then a matrix-matrix multiplication
	is performed, and finally the result is backtransformed to a tensor.
	The current implementation is significantly more efficient than previous
	ones capable of treating arbitrary high excitations.},

  abstract = {We have developed a symbolic manipulation program and program generator
	(tensor contraction engine or TCE) that abstracts and automates the
	time-consuming, error-prone processes of deriving the working equations
	of a well-defined model of second-quantized many-electron theories
	and synthesizing efficient parallel computer programs on the basis
	of these equations. Provided an ansatz of a many-electron theory
	model, TCE performs valid contractions of creation and annihilation
	operators according to Wick's theorem, consolidates identical terms,
	and reduces the expressions into the form of multiple tensor contractions
	acted upon by permutation operators. It subsequently determines the
	binary contraction order for each multiple tensor contraction with
	the minimal operation and memory cost, factorizes common binary contractions
	(defines intermediate tensors), and identifies reusable intermediates.
	The resulting ordered list of binary tensor contractions, additions,
	and index permutations is translated into an optimized program that
	is combined with the NWCHEM and UTCHEM computational chemistry software
	packages. The programs synthesized by TCE take advantage of spin
	symmetry (within the spinorbital formalisms), real Abelian point-group
	symmetry, and index permutation symmetry at every stage of the calculations
	to minimize the number of arithmetic operations and storage requirement,
	adjust the peak local memory usage by index-range tiling, and support
	parallel I/O interfaces and dynamic load balancing for parallel executions.
	We demonstrate the utility of TCE through automatic derivation and
	implementation of parallel programs for a range of predictive computational
	methodsconfiguration-interaction theory (CISD, CISDT, CISDTQ), generalized
	many-body perturbation theory MBPT(2), MBPT(3), MBPT(4), and coupled-cluster
	theory (LCCD, CCD, LCCSD, CCSD, QCISD, CCSDT, and CCSDTQ), some for
	the first timeand discuss the performance of the implemented programs.},

	are studied from the standpoint of density matrix theory. Their direct
	solution, which entails repeated determination of the individual
	occupied orbitals, is shown to be quite unnecessary. All information
	about the system under consideration can be obtained in terms of
	a one-particle density matrix; and this can be constructed by an
	iterative method which involves only matrix algebra. As an illustration
	of the method, the ground state of the beryllium atom is calculated.
	The solution, which is approximated in a basis of four Slater functions,
	surpasses in accuracy all other analytical one-determinant wave functions
	so far available, with one exception (Holoien, 1955). And although
	it approaches the accurate solution of the Hartree-Fock equations
	the computation required is relatively small. Extensions of the method,
	in order to admit configuration-interaction calculations, are also
	discussed. An appendix introduces a 'steepest descent' method of
	solving eigenvalence problems, which may be regarded as the prototype
	of the iterative construction described in the paper.},

	can be used to produce computable criteria to bound the inexactness
	of the matrix-vector multiplication in such a way as to maintain
	the convergence of the Krylov subspace method. The theory developed
	is applied to several problems including the solution of Schur complement
	systems, linear systems which depend on a parameter, and eigenvalue

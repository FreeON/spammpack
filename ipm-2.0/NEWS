IPM 2.0

DEC Alpha OSF v3.2 now supported.

SGI Irix 6.1, and support for all SGI machines added.

Factored out range and resolution reporting code.

Removed unused n_intervals code, should be slightly faster now.

Factored out common error reporting code, better error messages
including version number.

=============================================================================

IPM 1.11
Added function `IPM_timer_format' to return appropriate format string
to printf time.  Cleaned up format handling.

Moved IPM_timer_report out of modules into common central function,
made output more consistent and fits on single line.

Added more correct resolutions for getrusage and gettimeofday modules.

Changed environment variable controls to lower case.
E.g., old IPM_TIMER_MODULE=GETRUSAGE now IPM_timer_module=getrusage.

Made tag optional in IPM_timer_report, can use NULL to leave off tag.

Configure now complains if no timing modules found.

IPM 1.10
Fixed some bad distribution building targets in Makefile.

IPM 1.9
Improved documentation somewhat.

Removed clock_getres from SunOS5 IPM_timer_gethrtime module.  Was
returning wrong value and complicating configure.

Added further measurement of raw call overhead to IPM_timer_stats.

IPM 1.8

Wrote a new program "IPM_timer_stats", that measures the calling
overhead and resolution of the IPM timer.

IPM 1.7

Added UCB Regents copyright/disclaimer to source files.

Sundry makefile/configure fixes.

IPM 1.4

Removed advanced features from Makefile to make compatible with more
"make"s.  No more +=, and doesn't rely on VPATH.

Added some more text to INSTALL file.

Sundry other improvements to make process.

IPM 1.3

Made hard-coded resolutions and ranges over-rideable with preprocessor
symbols.

Added IPM_timer_get_time function to provide portable high resolution
clock interface.

Changed name of IPM_timer_val function to IPM_timer_read.

Compiled on Linux 1.2.8.

This library is an implementation of the Sparse Approximate Matrix
Multiplication (SpAMM) algorithm introduced in Refs. [1] and [2]. It provides
a matrix data type, and an approximate matrix product, which exhibits linear
scaling computational complexity for matrices with decay. The product error
and the performance of the multiply can be tuned by choosing an appropriate
tolerance. The library can be compiled for serial executation or parallel
execution on shared memory systems with an OpenMP capable compiler.

PAPI profiling is enabled with a configure line such as this one:

./configure --enable-PAPI CPPFLAGS="-DC99 -I/usr/local/papi-4.1.0/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/papi-4.1.0/lib"

For glib, one might have to tell configure where to find it:

./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/glib-2.0\ -I/usr/lib/glib-2.0/include

PAPI profiling is enabled with a configure line such as this one:

./configure --enable-PAPI CPPFLAGS="-DC99 -I/usr/local/papi-4.1.0/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/papi-4.1.0/lib"

For glib, one might have to tell configure where to find it:

./configure CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/glib-2.0\ -I/usr/lib/glib-2.0/include

 *
 * \brief Sparse Approximate Matrix Multiply (SpAMM) library.
 *
 * SpAMM is a library for spare approximate matrices.
 *
 * The public functions of this library are all declared in spamm.h. Useful
 * helper functions are documented in spamm_ll.h and spamm_mm.h.
 *
 * \section Introduction
 *
 * A spamm_t matrix is defined as an \f$ N \f$-tree on the 2-dimensional
 * matrix elements. The matrix elements at the lowest level are stored in
 * dense matrix blocks. The matrix is padded with zeros so that the tree depth
 * \f$ d \f$ is integer according to
 *
 * \f[
 * M = M_{\mathrm{block}} M_{\mathrm{child}}^d
 * \]
 * \[
 * N = N_{\mathrm{block}} N_{\mathrm{child}}^d
 * \f]
 *
 * where \f$ M \f$ (\f$ N \f$) is the number of rows (columns) of the matrix,
 * \f$ M_{\mathrm{block}} \f$ (\f$ N_{\mathrm{block}} \f$) is the number of
 * rows (columns) of the dense matrix blocks at the lowest tree level, \f$
 * M_{\mathrm{child}} \f$ (\f$ N_{\mathrm{child}} \f$) is the number of rows
 * (columns) of the children nodes per node in the matrix tree, and \f$ d \f$
 * is the depth of the tree. This means that the matrix tree is a quadtree for
 * \f$ M_{\mathrm{child}} = N_{\mathrm{child}} = 2 \f$.

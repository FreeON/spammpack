 *
 * \brief Sparse Approximate Matrix Multiply (SpAMM) library.
 *
 * SpAMM is a library for spare approximate matrices.
 *
 * The public functions of this library are all declared in spamm.h. Useful
 * helper functions are documented in spamm_ll.h and spamm_mm.h.
 *
 * \section introduction Introduction
 *
 * A spamm_t matrix is defined as an \f$ N \f$-tree on the 2-dimensional
 * matrix elements. The matrix elements at the lowest level are stored in
 * dense matrix blocks. The matrix is padded with zeros so that the tree depth
 * \f$ d \f$ is integer according to
 *
 * \f[
 * M = M_{\mathrm{block}} M_{\mathrm{child}}^d
 * \]
 * \[
 * N = N_{\mathrm{block}} N_{\mathrm{child}}^d
 * \f]
 *
 * where \f$ M \f$ (\f$ N \f$) is the number of rows (columns) of the matrix,
 * \f$ M_{\mathrm{block}} \f$ (\f$ N_{\mathrm{block}} \f$) is the number of
 * rows (columns) of the dense matrix blocks at the lowest tree level, \f$
 * M_{\mathrm{child}} \f$ (\f$ N_{\mathrm{child}} \f$) is the number of rows
 * (columns) of the children nodes per node in the matrix tree, and \f$ d \f$
 * is the depth of the tree. This means that the matrix tree is a quadtree for
 * \f$ M_{\mathrm{child}} = N_{\mathrm{child}} = 2 \f$.
 *
 * \section algorithm Algorithm
 *
 * The multiplication is divided into a symbolic part and a multiplication
 * part. The symbolic part constructs the matrix product convolution such that
 * it creates up to N copies of each \f$ C_{ij} \f$ block to allow for full
 * parallelism in the multiplication part. This data redundancy circumvents
 * possible race conditions in \f$ C \f$ and we can take full advantage of SMP
 * in the multiply. The multiplication part then works through the convolution
 * stream and parallelizes multiplies if possible (i.e. if we are running on
 * SMP). In a final stage, the redundant \f$ C \f$ blocks are summed and the
 * final \f$ C \f$ matrix is constructed.
 *
 * -# Symbolic: Construct convolution with redundant \f$ C_{ij} \f$ blocks.
 * -# Multiplication: Work through convolution and parallelize work as much as
 *  possible.
 * -# Sum: Sum redundant \f$ C_{ij} \f$ blocks to construct final \f$ C \f$
 *   matrix.
